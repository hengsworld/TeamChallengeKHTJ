# TeamChallengeKHTJ

This Repository consists of the code for the Team Challenge. It is a sign-up form for an imaginary social media site asking the user for their email address, first name, last name, birth date, password, and password confirmation. Each input has various validation requirements which can be tested by running the included automated tests.
